# RoadLaneLinesDetectionSystems

# Description
This project takes an input video of a car driving down a road, computes the road boundaries, and estimates lane divider markings and providing a real time feedback to drivers.

# Assumptions
>Driving on the LEFT side of a two-lane road (see the image for an example)

>Driving during daylight; due to limitations on a sufficient quality video.
